# The variables {PATH} and {NAME} are replaced before configuration is used
# Configuration syntax isn't obviously documented,; read the parser source at http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=blob;f=util/qemu-config.c then grep for things like 'QEMU_OPT_STRING', 'QEMU_OPT_SIZE', 'QEMU_OPT_BOOL' and 'QEMU_OPT_NUMBER'
# Configuration is scattered all over the code base.
